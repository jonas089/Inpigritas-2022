[TBD: Transfers]


Submit Transfer to network:

n: current height
x: validations it takes for a transaction to be included in a block
Send to endpoint of every node.
If Node does not have a txpool for the n+x th Block it creates one.
Node saves transfer to txpool of n+x Block & sorts the txpool by timestamp.
On block creation: Nodes sync their txpool for the current block.
=> Block creation will automatically delete the temp file for the current Block ( if any )

Major advantage over including a Transfer in the current block is that the risk of a tx getting lost is super low.

Validate Transfer:

add balance checks

Additional Security:

hash block transfers to prevent order corruption or potential attacks
